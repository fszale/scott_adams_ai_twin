### Meet Scott Adams' AI Twin!
Scott Adams (creator of Dilbert) has announced his terminal illness during his YouTube stream (Coffee with Scott Adams) on May 19th, 2025.

He has often shared his desire to share enough content to allow creation of his digital twin.

I am humbly answering his call with this little project.

Thank you for your contribution to the consciousness.

Godspeed Scott Adams!
